## Reporting a Vulnerability
This instance of glitch isn't anything for anyone to be concerned about. 
I'm sure the Glitch.me team is quick to resolve any issues with the official build.
This particular version was meant for personal exploration.
I won't be publishing it as part of my own software or other offering.
